ðŸš€ Welcome to my Portfolio Website Repository! ðŸš€

This repository contains the foundational codebase for my personal portfolio website.

The initial version serves as a showcase of fundamental web development principles, demonstrating my proficiency in leveraging AWS services to construct a scalable and cost-efficient serverless web application. It provides insight into my basic understanding of select AWS services.

In the forthcoming release, I'll unveil a comprehensive iteration of my portfolio website, harnessing React and other contemporary technologies to elevate its functionality and user experience.

### Future Enhancements:
- **Project Showcase:** Featuring detailed descriptions of my projects alongside the technologies employed.
- **Accomplishments & Certificates:** Exhibiting my certifications and achievements to offer a holistic perspective on my skills and accomplishments.
- **About Me:** Offering a glimpse into my background, interests, and aspirations for the future.

I invite you to explore this repository and stay tuned for updates as I continue to enhance and refine my portfolio website!
